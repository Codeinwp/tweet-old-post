> define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);

**Post are not sent to the social networks and i always see the green badge with 'You can refresh the page to see the next schedule !'**

- You need to add this line to your wp-config.php right after the lines with database credentials:

  > define('ALTERNATE_WP_CRON', true);
