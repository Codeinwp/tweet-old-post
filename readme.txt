**Before asking any question you need to check if you have the latest version, either PRO or FREE.**


**Plugin doesn't post at the regular interval or sends more posts than it should send to social networks.**

- Unfortunately wp_cron function isn't perfect, it trigger just when somebody visit your site, so you nobody visit your site in 3 hours, ROP won't trigger. In order to achieve this you need to enable Remote Check and add this line to your wp-config.php right after the lines with database credentials:

> define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);

**Post are not sent to the social networks and i always see the green badge with 'You can refresh the page to see the next schedule !'**

- You need to add this line to your wp-config.php right after the lines with database credentials:

  > define('ALTERNATE_WP_CRON', true);
