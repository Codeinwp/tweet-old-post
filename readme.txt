## How Can Revive Old Posts Help Me?

Revive Old Posts is much more than just a wp to facebook or wp to twitter plugin. ROP can be used for many use cases and help many different blogs and sites boost their social media traffic by introducing social media automation functionality to WordPress, it can act as all of the following in one:

### A WordPress **Social Media Scheduling** Plugin

With our plugin, you can set a schedule for how often you'd like your **old and newer content** to share to social media **a feature 100% FREE**.

Set how many hours should be between posts or go deeper into scheduling (PRO) by setting the time of day and days of the week you'd like the plugin to post to social media.

### A WordPress **Social Media Auto post** Plugin

Just finished writing an awesome blog post? Why wait until it gets shared? Automatically post to social media as soon as you click the publish button!

Auto posting is a handy feature for users who want to share to social media as soon as they're done creating their content.

### A WP **Scheduled Post** Plugin

Are you creating posts that get published at a later time in the future? With ROP, you can have those posts automatically published to your active social media accounts as soon as WordPress publishes those posts for you!

This feature takes into account filters you have set in the plugin settings, so it won't share Cat posts if you have added the Cat posts category to your excluded categories!

### A WordPress **Social Media Analytics** Plugin

Tired of manually adding UTM tags to posts to track the source of your traffic?

With ROP, shares to social media automatically include UTM tags to help you identify which included social networks your traffic is coming from.

Easily see how much social media auto posting is helping with your website traffic inside Google Analytics.

### A WordPress **Content Curation** Plugin

Social media marketing can be a tedious job, especially when it comes to deciding what content to share to social networks.

With our plugin, it is possible to implement curation capabilities by **filtering out** the posts you **don't want to** share to social media, with just a few clicks.

Once set, the plugin will then be able to determine which content to auto share to social media.

### A RSS to Social Media Plugin

With our Revive Network addon, you can share posts from any RSS feed to Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Tumblr, Google My Business, Vkontakte(VK) or Instagram (imported post needs to have an image).
